<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Everymorning we go to work and open our computer screen and start typing away without the right mindset. Not having the right mindset can affect your performance throughout the day in what ever you are doing.</p>
<p> I have created Mindful Mornings, a place where you can be aware of three specific things to get you started on the day: </p>
<p><strong>Mindful Thought</strong>: Reading a inspirational quote to inspire you and think about as you start your day </p>
<p> <strong>Mindful Day</strong>: Knowing when the sunrises and sunsets keeps you aware when it's good time to start and end yoru day </p>
<p> <strong>Mindful Surrounding</strong>: Searching whatever is on your mind that is linked to current events gives you insight what is going around you and hopefully inspires you do change the world</p>

<h2> How to Use it</h2>
<p>It is best to use this when you start your day or if you need to reset during the day.</p>
<p> Step One: Mindful Morning: Look at the inspirational quote and think how you can live this quote today </p>
<p> Step Two: Mindful Day: Looking at when the sunrose lets you know the day has already started. Looking at sunsets lets you know when the day will end and keep in mind to have a work life balance</p>
<p> Step Three: Search for something that has been on your mind. Articles will appear and at least choose one to read. </p>
